/*
  # Fix RLS policies for event creation
  
  1. Changes
    - Add policies for admins to create/update/delete events
    - Add policies for producers to create/update their own events
    - Ensure producers can view all DJs (needed for event creation)
    - Ensure producers can view all other producers (needed for event creation)
  
  2. Security
    - Maintain restrictive access while allowing necessary operations
    - Admins have full access to everything
    - Producers can create events and see necessary data
